Create a [VISUALIZATION_TYPE] animation that explores [CONCEPT] through [STYLE_CHOICE] visual representation.

Core Requirements:
1. Technical Implementation
- Use TypeScript with React
- Implement as a client-side component
- Optimize with dynamic imports
- Maintain responsive aspect-square container

2. Visual Philosophy
- Represent [CONCEPT] through [GEOMETRIC/ASCII/PARTICLE] elements
- Balance complexity with accessibility
- Incorporate subtle, organic motion
- Support interactive user engagement
- Emergent Patterns

3. Motion Characteristics
- Frame rate: 30fps for smooth animation
- Include natural physics parameters (damping, tension)
- Implement perspective/depth where relevant
- Add subtle auto-animation for passive state

4. Interactive Elements
- Mouse/touch response with smooth transitions
- Radius-based impact effects
- Velocity and force calculations
- Boundary constraints for stability

5. Performance Considerations
- Efficient state management
- Optimized render cycles
- Memory-conscious data structures
- Graceful degradation on lower-end devices

Variables to customize:
- [VISUALIZATION_TYPE]: Wave, Sphere, Field, Grid, etc.
- [CONCEPT]: Mathematical principle or data structure to visualize
- [STYLE_CHOICE]: ASCII, 3D geometry, particles, etc.
- [GEOMETRIC/ASCII/PARTICLE]: Primary visual element type

Important Rules:
- Matrix Rain animation or other generic ascii animations are forbidden!!
- Animations should work on touch devices and traditional input linke mouse or trackpad
- optimized with modern react 19 optimizations
